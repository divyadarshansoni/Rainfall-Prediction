## Rainfall-Prediction

This is a machine learning project about predicting rainfall and finding the best model to predict it.

In this project I - //
1 Developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict rainfall using a dataset of weather conditions, employing models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost.//
2 Handled data preprocessing steps including missing data imputation, class imbalance handling through oversampling, outlier detection, and feature selection.//
3 Applied feature scaling and transformation techniques such as MinMax Scaling and Label Encoding to optimize model performance.//
4 Performed model evaluation using multiple metrics: accuracy, ROC-AUC, Cohen's Kappa, and execution time.//
5 Visualized model decision boundaries and compared performance across models using plots, including ROC curves and confusion matrices.//
6 Successfully selected the best-performing models and optimized hyperparameters for predicting rainfall events with high accuracy.//
